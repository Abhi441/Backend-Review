//////////////////Services
Services are classes responsible for implementing the core business logic of your application.

Key Purpose: 
1)Encapsulation of Business Logic .
2) Reusability
3)Testability.
4)Dependency Injection (DI).

Typical Responsibility of Services:
Data Access:
Business Rules :
Integration :
Notifications :
Loggins : 

Best Practices

â€¢ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Design your services to have a single responsibility to keep them focused and maintainable.

Dependency Injection: Use dependency injection to
manage service lifetimes and dependencies, making your code loosely coupled and easier to test.

Interface-Based Programming: Define interfaces for your services to create abstraction layers and facilitate testing with mocks.

Clear Naming: Use descriptive names for your services and their methods to make your code self-documenting.

Testing: Write unit tests for your services to ensure that your business logic works correctly in isolation.

DIP(Dependency Inversion Principal)
In simpler terms 
Instead of tightly coupling your classes by having them depend on concrete implementations, they should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).

This allows you to easily swap out implementations without changing the higher-level code.


/////////////////////////
Dependency Injection (DI):
The most common way to do this in ASP.NET Core is through constructor injection, but there are also other techniques like property injection and method injection.

Benefits of DIP, IoC, and DI

Loose Coupling:

Flexibility: 

Testability:
